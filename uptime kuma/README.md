Stand up [Uptime Kuma](https://github.com/louislam/uptime-kuma), and a [Signal CLI REST API](https://github.com/bbernhard/signal-cli-rest-api) client to use for sending monitoring alerts using [Signal](https://signal.org/)


## Uptime Kuma
1. Create folders and Compose file
```
mkdir ~/docker/uptime-kuma
nano ~/docker/uptime-kuma/compose.yaml
```
2. Copy ```uptime-kuma-compose.yaml```, save, and exit
3. Deploy the container
```
docker compose -f ~/docker/uptime-kuma/compose.yaml up -d
```
3. Open a web browser to **http://[server IP:3001]**


## Signal CLI REST API Client
1. Create folders and Compose file
```
mkdir ~/docker/signal-cli
mkdir ~/docker/signal-cli/signal-cli-config
nano ~/docker/signal-cli/compose.yaml
```
2. Copy ```signal-cli-compose.yaml```, save, and exit
3. Deploy the container
```
docker compose -f ~/docker/signal-cli/compose.yaml up -d
```
4. Query the API (can be done from the server, or from another device)
```
curl -X 'GET' 'http://[signal client IP]:8080/v1/about' -H 'accept: application/json'
```
5. Generate a Signal device registry QR code
```
curl -X 'GET' 'http://[signal client IP]:8080/v1/qrcodelink?device_name=[device name]' -H 'accept: application/json'
```
**NOTE** - you may receive response ```error: "Couldn't create QR code: no data to encode"```. If so, try a different ```MODE``` option in ```compose.yaml```

6. Register the device with your Signal app:
* Tap your user icon > Linked Devices > Link a new device
* Scan the QR code
* Tap Add device
7. See [Signal Swagger site](https://bbernhard.github.io/signal-cli-rest-api/) for usage information


## Add Signal notifications to Uptime Kuma
1. From the Uptime Kuma console, click the upper right menu button > Settings > Notifications, and click Setup Notification

* Notification type: Signal
* Friendly Name: [your device name]
* Post URL: ```http://[signal client IP]:8080/v2/send```
* Number: [the phone number associated to the Signal account]
* Recipients: [phone number recipient]
3. Click Test to send a message verifying functionality. You should receive a Signal message: ```[friendly name] Testing```
4. Click Save
5. Add notifications to your monitors by toggling the friendly device name in the Notifications settings. Alerts should arrive by Signal message.
